### Attacks

The boss can use a variety of attacks against the player at random. With 8 different attacks in the bosses arsenal, it is able to catch the player off guard if they are not focused.

![Attack 1](.ReadMeImages/Attack1.gif)

In the first attack, the boss summons a portal that charges up for 4 seconds, before shooting 10 spikes around it. These spikes can be parried or dodged, however if they hit the wall, they turn into flying eyeballs that home onto the player. These eyeballs are far harder to dodge than the spikes, making well timed parries a necessity.

![Attack2](.ReadMeImages/Attack2.gif)

When using its second attack, the boss creates an image of itself ontop of the player, known as a doppelganger. The boss will teleport to the doppelgangers location a second after it appears and shoot 3 bursts of 3 spikes at the player. While doing this, it will summon another doppelganger to the left or right of the player and repeat until the attack ends. Parrying can be used against this attack, however it cant be relied on due to its cooldown.Therefor, dodging is required to survive this attack. 

![Attack3](.ReadMeImages/Attack3.gif)

The bosses third attack also utilises the doppelganger. The boss summons the doppelganger ontop of the boss, and after 1 second, the boss teleports to the doppelgangers location and shoots continous bursts of spikes towards the player. Parrying and dodging is required to survive this attack.

![Attack4](.ReadMeImages/Attack4.gif)

The fourth attack starts off with the floor disappearing and infinite flight being granted for the duration of the attack. This is done to provide more manoeuvrability to dodge the attack. It features portals spawning at a 12 unit radius away from the player at a random angle. Another portal will spawn opposite to that portal as a decoy. The main portal will spawn a line of 5 spikes that move quickly towards the other portal before disappearing. Constant fast movements are good for dodging this attack as moving will get you out of the way of majority of the portals.

![Attack5](.ReadMeImages/Attack5.gif)

The bosses fifth attack also removes the floor and gives the player infinite flight. This attack spawns a center portal on the player aswell as portals at a 20 unit radius on either side away from the centre portal that circle around the center for the duration of the attack. Each portal shoots spikes towards the centre circle, creating a circular dodging motion for the player. The player is advised to stay close to the centre of the attack as it means they have to moves less distance. They can also parry if they mess up, however parrying is risky due to the high damage of the attack.

![Attack6](.ReadMeImages/Attack6.gif)

The bosses sixth attack is very similar to the fifth attack. The difference is that the outside portals move at slower speeds, however there are now four portals shooting at once, instead of two. For this attack, it is better to stay further away from the centre. This is because the attack moves slower, meaning less distance in needed to be made. That means remaining on the outside provides more room to avoid the spikes.

![Attack7](.ReadMeImages/Attack7.gif)

Attack seven features the boss charging up a portal before it shoots spikes out in a circle. This attacks charge up phase is almost identical to attack 1, however less purple colouring is present in this attack so that the player can differentiate the two. Precise parry timing is necessary in order to dodge this attack.

## Future Updates
### More Enemies
In future updates, I plan to add more enemies to the game as I feel the game is lacking in variety. This will make the game more interesting and intense for the player, creating an overall more enjoyable experience
### Boss Update
I plan on adding a second phase to the boss, aswell as an updgrade to the bosses visuals, such as making it's shader slowly intensify as its health lowers.
### More Rooms
I plan on adding more rooms to my game as it currently lacks in exploration. This will make the game overall more enjoyable and engaging
